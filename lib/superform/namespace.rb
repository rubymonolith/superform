module Superform
  # A Namespace maps and object to values, but doesn't actually have a value itself. For
  # example, a `User` object or ActiveRecord model could be passed into the `:user` namespace.
  # To access the values on a Namespace, the `field` can be called for single values.
  #
  # Additionally, to access namespaces within a namespace, such as if a `User has_many :addresses` in
  # ActiveRecord, the `namespace` method can be called which will return another Namespace object and
  # set the current Namespace as the parent.

    # the `@children` Hash to ensure duplicate child namespaces aren't created, then calls the

    #
    # For example, if a `User#permission` returns a `Permission` object, we could map that to a
    # form like this:
    #
    # ```ruby
    # Superform :user, object: User.new do |form|
    #   form.namespace :permission do |permission|
    #     form.field :role
    #   end

    # read and set by the form. For example, a User form might look like this:

    # Superform :user, object: User.new do |form|
    #   form.field :email
    #   form.field :name
    # end

    # an enumerable or array of `Address` classes:
    #
    # ```ruby
    # Superform :user, object: User.new do |form|
    #   form.field :email
    #   form.field :name
    #   form.collection :addresses do |address|

    #     address.field(:state)
    #     address.field(:zip)
